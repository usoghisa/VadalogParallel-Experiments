Database Configuration.

Open the PostgreSQL configuration file (postgresql.conf) and adjust the following parameters:

max_parallel_workers: This parameter sets the maximum number of parallel workers that can be used by the system.
Increase this value to allow more parallel workers. For example:
max_parallel_workers = 4

max_parallel_workers_per_gather: This parameter controls the maximum number of parallel workers
that can be used in a single query. Set it to a reasonable value. For example:
max_parallel_workers_per_gather = 2

max_worker_processes: Ensure that max_worker_processes is set to a value that allows
for the number of parallel workers you plan to use.

parallel_setup_cost and parallel_tuple_cost: These parameters influence the query planner's decisions
regarding parallelism. Adjust these values to reflect the costs associated with parallel execution
in your specific environment.

After making changes to postgresql.conf, you'll need to restart the PostgreSQL server
for the new configuration settings to take effect.
